# JigsawFlow Best Practices

Implementation patterns and techniques for building robust, efficient JigsawFlow applications.

---

## Core Architectural Requirements

### Offline-First Design

All JigsawFlow modules must be designed to function independently without external dependencies or network connectivity.

**Mandatory Requirements:**

- Modules must operate fully when disconnected from networks or external services
- Implement graceful degradation when external resources are unavailable
- Cache essential data locally to maintain functionality during outages
- Design for eventual consistency rather than real-time synchronization
- Provide meaningful functionality even with stale or limited data

**Benefits:**

- Enhanced reliability in unstable network environments
- Improved user experience during connectivity issues
- Simplified testing without external service dependencies
- Better performance through local data access
- Increased system resilience and fault tolerance

### Module Independence Principle

Modules must never directly depend on other modules. Any shared functionality must be unified into a single module.

**Strict Requirements:**

- **No Inter-Module Dependencies**: Modules cannot directly reference or import other modules
  **Shared Functionality Guidance**: If modules need shared functionality, prefer extracting it into a separate shared module or refactor boundaries. Avoid tight coupling; prefer interfaces and graceful degradation
  **Communication Flexibility**: Use the DI registry, event-driven messaging, channels, IPC, or other appropriate mechanisms—no single method is prescribed
- **Interface-Based Coupling**: Modules depend only on traits/interfaces, never concrete implementations

**Enforcement Guidelines:**

- Analyze module boundaries during design to prevent dependency coupling
- Refactor shared code into common modules rather than creating dependencies
- Use composition over inheritance to avoid module coupling
- Design modules as completely self-contained units

### Facade Pattern for External Dependencies

All language standard utilities and environmental access must be wrapped through facade functions registered in the singleton registry.

**Mandatory Wrapping:**

- **File System Access**: Wrap all file I/O operations through singleton registry facades
- **Network Operations**: Abstract all network calls behind interface facades
- **Environment Variables**: Access system environment through singleton registry functions
- **Time/Date Functions**: Wrap time operations for consistent testing and mocking
- **Random Number Generation**: Abstract randomness for deterministic testing
- **System Calls**: Wrap all OS-specific operations through facades

**Testing Benefits:**

- **Complete Mockability**: Every external dependency can be mocked for testing
- **Deterministic Testing**: Control all external inputs for reproducible test results
- **Isolated Unit Tests**: Test module logic without external system dependencies
- **Simplified Test Setup**: No complex mocking frameworks required
- **Natural Service Substitution**: Singleton registry provides seamless mock substitution

**Implementation Pattern:**

1. Create facade interfaces for all external operations
2. Register concrete implementations in singleton registry during normal operation
3. Register mock implementations during testing
4. Modules access external functionality only through singleton registry facades

## Core Implementation Patterns

### Lazy Loading & Caching

Any singleton should implement its own efficient resource management through lazy initialization and intelligent caching strategies.

Future: a thin abstraction will standardize lazy initialization and caching patterns across languages.

#### Lightweight Initialization Pattern

Create module structures that defer expensive operations until first access.

Pre-calculation can be triggered via a deliberate first access to warm caches.

**Pattern Overview:**

- `::new()` or equivalent constructor creates minimal structure
- Expensive resources (configuration files, database connections, remote data) load on demand
- Results cached at module level for subsequent access
- Particularly effective for configuration modules requiring remote downloads

**Benefits:**

- Faster application startup times
- Reduced memory footprint during initialization
- Improved fault tolerance (failures occur at access time, not startup)
- Better resource utilization in multi-module applications

**Use Cases:**

- Configuration modules downloading from remote sources
- Database connection pools
- External API clients
- Large data structure initialization

#### Caching Strategies

**Module-Level Caching:**

- Cache expensive computations within module boundaries
- Implement cache invalidation for dynamic data
- Consider memory constraints in long-running applications

---

### Builder Pattern Integration

Leverage the singleton registry's function registration capabilities to implement flexible object construction patterns.

#### Factory Function Registration

Register builder functions as first-class citizens in the singleton registry:

**Simple Builders:**

- Register factory functions that construct objects with default configurations
- Enable parameterized construction through closure capture

**Complex Multi-Step Builders:**

- Break construction into discrete, testable steps
- Register intermediate builder stages as separate functions
- Enable builder composition through singleton registry coordination

#### Builder Pattern Benefits

**Flexibility:**

- Construct objects with varying configurations
- Support optional parameters and default values
- Enable runtime configuration of object construction

**Testability:**

- Mock individual construction steps
- Test builder logic independently from constructed objects
- Verify construction parameters through builder inspection

**Maintainability:**

- Separate construction logic from object implementation
- Enable construction pattern reuse across modules
- Support construction pattern evolution without breaking existing code

## Module Design Patterns

### Single Responsibility Modules

Design modules with focused, well-defined purposes following the PLC unit paradigm:

**Guidelines:**

- Each module should solve one specific domain problem
- Avoid feature creep within module boundaries
- Prefer module composition over monolithic module design
- Design for replaceability and hot-swapping

### Interface-First Development

Define module contracts before implementation:

**Process:**

1. Define trait/interface specifications for module capabilities
2. Establish input/output contracts and data formats
3. Explore generic trait/interface collections—modules may interoperate in ways not originally anticipated
4. Implement module logic to satisfy interface contracts
5. Register module capabilities through singleton registry

**Benefits:**

- Clear module boundaries and responsibilities
- Enhanced testability through interface mocking
- Simplified module replacement and versioning
- Better cross-language compatibility

### Dependency Declaration

Explicitly declare module dependencies through the singleton registry:

**Patterns:**

- Request dependencies by trait/interface, not concrete types
- Handle missing dependencies gracefully with fallback strategies
- Minimize dependency coupling through interface abstraction
- Support optional dependencies for enhanced functionality

---

## Performance Optimization

### Module Loading Strategies

**Static Loading (Phase 1):**

- Load all required modules during application initialization
- Optimize for predictable startup performance
- Suitable for applications with known module requirements

**Dynamic Loading (Phase 2 - RuntimeSwap):**

- Load modules on-demand based on runtime requirements
- Optimize for memory usage and startup time
- Handle loading failures and fallback scenarios

### Communication Optimization

**Intra-Application Communication:**

- Prefer direct singleton registry access for same-process modules
- Minimize serialization overhead for local communication
- Use efficient data structures for high-frequency interactions

**Cross-Application Communication:**

- Choose appropriate protocols based on performance requirements
- Implement connection pooling for network-based communication
- Consider message batching for high-throughput scenarios

### Memory Management

These are generic recommendations for software development, not tied to the JigsawFlow pattern

**Module Lifecycle:**

- Implement proper cleanup in module shutdown procedures
- Release expensive resources when modules are replaced
- Monitor memory usage in long-running applications

**Resource Sharing:**

- Use singleton registry for sharing expensive resources across modules
- Consider resource pooling for frequently created/destroyed objects

---

## Error Handling & Resilience

### Graceful Degradation

Design modules to handle dependency failures gracefully:

**Strategies:**

- Implement fallback functionality when dependencies are unavailable
- Provide reduced functionality rather than complete failure
- Log dependency issues for monitoring and debugging

### Module Isolation

Prevent module failures from cascading across the application:

**Techniques:**

- Implement error boundaries around module operations
- Isolate module state to prevent cross-contamination

- Use circuit breaker patterns (if appropriate) to detect and prevent cascading failures when external dependencies become unavailable; this allows the system to recover more quickly from outages and reduces the load on the failed dependency during the outage

### Hot-Swap Safety

Ensure safe module replacement during runtime:

**Guidelines:**

- Implement proper cleanup procedures before module replacement
- Handle in-flight operations during module swapping
- Validate new module compatibility before activation
- Provide rollback mechanisms for failed module updates

---

## Testing Strategies

### Module Unit Testing

**Isolation Testing:**

- Test modules in isolation using mocked dependencies
- Verify interface contract compliance
- Test error handling and edge cases

**Integration Testing:**

- Test module interactions through singleton registry
- Verify communication patterns and data flow
- Test module replacement and hot-swapping scenarios

### Builder Pattern Testing

**Factory Function Testing:**

- Test builder functions independently
- Verify constructed object properties and behavior
- Test builder parameter validation and error handling

**Construction Process Testing:**

- Test multi-step construction workflows
- Verify intermediate state handling
- Test construction failure recovery

---

## Security Considerations

### Module Sandboxing

**Trust Boundaries:**

- Establish clear trust levels for different module sources
- Implement sandboxing for untrusted modules (future enhancement)
- Validate module signatures and integrity

### Communication Security

**Protocol Security:**

- Use encrypted communication channels for sensitive data
- Implement authentication and authorization for cross-application communication
- Validate message integrity and prevent tampering

### Resource Access Control

**Capability-Based Security:**

- Limit module access to required resources only
- Implement fine-grained permission systems
- Monitor and log resource access patterns

---

## Monitoring & Debugging

### Module Observability

**Logging Strategies:**

- Implement structured logging within modules
- Include module identity and version information in logs
- Use correlation IDs for cross-module operation tracking

**Metrics Collection:**

- Support runtime module configuration changes

**Communication Debugging:**

- Log inter-module communication for troubleshooting
- Implement message tracing across module boundaries
- Provide tools for communication pattern visualization

---

## Migration Strategies

### Legacy System Integration

**Incremental Adoption:**

- Start with non-critical system components
- Implement JigsawFlow modules alongside existing systems
- Gradually replace legacy components with modular alternatives

**Wrapper Modules:**

- Create JigsawFlow modules that wrap existing functionality
- Provide interface adaptation for legacy systems
- Enable gradual migration without system disruption

### Monolith Decomposition

**Boundary Identification:**

- Analyze existing system to identify natural module boundaries
