# JigsawFlow Best Practices

Implementation patterns and techniques for building robust, efficient JigsawFlow applications.

---

## Core Architectural Requirements

### Offline-First Design

All JigsawFlow components must be designed to function independently without external dependencies or network connectivity.

**Mandatory Requirements:**

- Components must operate fully when disconnected from networks or external services
- Implement graceful degradation when external resources are unavailable
- Cache essential data locally to maintain functionality during outages
- Design for eventual consistency rather than real-time synchronization
- Provide meaningful functionality even with stale or limited data

**Benefits:**

- Enhanced reliability in unstable network environments
- Improved user experience during connectivity issues
- Simplified testing without external service dependencies
- Better performance through local data access
- Increased system resilience and fault tolerance

### Component Independence Principle

Components must never directly depend on other components. Any shared functionality must be unified into a single component.

**Strict Requirements:**

- **No Inter-Component Dependencies**: Components cannot directly reference or import other components
  **Shared Functionality Guidance**: If components need shared functionality, prefer extracting it into a separate shared component or refactor boundaries. Avoid tight coupling; prefer interfaces and graceful degradation
  **Communication Flexibility**: Use the DI registry, event-driven messaging, channels, IPC, or other appropriate mechanisms—no single method is prescribed
- **Interface-Based Coupling**: Components depend only on traits/interfaces, never concrete implementations

**Enforcement Guidelines:**

- Analyze component boundaries during design to prevent dependency coupling
- Refactor shared code into common components rather than creating dependencies
- Use composition over inheritance to avoid component coupling
- Design components as completely self-contained elements

### Facade Pattern for External Dependencies

All language standard utilities and environmental access must be wrapped through facade functions registered in the singleton registry.

**Mandatory Wrapping:**

- **File System Access**: Wrap all file I/O operations through singleton registry facades
- **Network Operations**: Abstract all network calls behind interface facades
- **Environment Variables**: Access system environment through singleton registry functions
- **Time/Date Functions**: Wrap time operations for consistent testing and mocking
- **Random Number Generation**: Abstract randomness for deterministic testing
- **System Calls**: Wrap all OS-specific operations through facades

**Testing Benefits:**

- **Complete Mockability**: Every external dependency can be mocked for testing
- **Deterministic Testing**: Control all external inputs for reproducible test results
- **Isolated Unit Tests**: Test module logic without external system dependencies
- **Simplified Test Setup**: No complex mocking frameworks required
- **Natural Service Substitution**: Singleton registry provides seamless mock substitution

**Implementation Pattern:**

1. Create facade interfaces for all external operations
2. Register concrete implementations in singleton registry during normal operation
3. Register mock implementations during testing
4. Modules access external functionality only through singleton registry facades

## Core Implementation Patterns

### Lazy Loading & Caching

Any singleton should implement its own efficient resource management through lazy initialization and intelligent caching strategies.

Future: a thin abstraction will standardize lazy initialization and caching patterns across languages.

#### Lightweight Initialization Pattern

Create component structures that defer expensive operations until first access.

Pre-calculation can be triggered via a deliberate first access to warm caches.

**Pattern Overview:**

- `::new()` or equivalent constructor creates minimal structure
- Expensive resources (configuration files, database connections, remote data) load on demand
- Results cached at component level for subsequent access
- Particularly effective for configuration components requiring remote downloads

**Benefits:**

- Faster application startup times
- Reduced memory footprint during initialization
- Improved fault tolerance (failures occur at access time, not startup)
- Better resource utilization in multi-component applications

**Use Cases:**

- Configuration components downloading from remote sources
- Database connection pools
- External API clients
- Large data structure initialization

#### Caching Strategies

**Component-Level Caching:**

- Cache expensive computations within component boundaries
- Implement cache invalidation for dynamic data
- Consider memory constraints in long-running applications

---

### Builder Pattern Integration

Leverage the singleton registry's function registration capabilities to implement flexible object construction patterns.

#### Factory Function Registration

Register builder functions as first-class citizens in the singleton registry:

**Simple Builders:**

- Register factory functions that construct objects with default configurations
- Enable parameterized construction through closure capture

**Complex Multi-Step Builders:**

- Break construction into discrete, testable steps
- Register intermediate builder stages as separate functions
- Enable builder composition through singleton registry coordination

#### Builder Pattern Benefits

**Flexibility:**

- Construct objects with varying configurations
- Support optional parameters and default values
- Enable runtime configuration of object construction

**Testability:**

- Mock individual construction steps
- Test builder logic independently from constructed objects
- Verify construction parameters through builder inspection

**Maintainability:**

- Separate construction logic from object implementation
- Enable construction pattern reuse across components
- Support construction pattern evolution without breaking existing code

## Component Design Patterns

### Single Responsibility Components

Design components with focused, well-defined purposes following the PLC component paradigm:

**Guidelines:**

- Each component should solve one specific domain problem
- Avoid feature creep within component boundaries
- Prefer component composition over monolithic component design
- Design for replaceability and hot-swapping

### Interface-First Development

Define component contracts before implementation:

**Process:**

1. Define trait/interface specifications for component capabilities
2. Establish input/output contracts and data formats
3. Explore generic trait/interface collections—components may interoperate in ways not originally anticipated
4. Implement component logic to satisfy interface contracts
5. Register component capabilities through singleton registry

**Benefits:**

- Clear component boundaries and responsibilities
- Enhanced testability through interface mocking
- Simplified component replacement and versioning
- Better cross-language compatibility

### Dependency Declaration

Explicitly declare component dependencies through the singleton registry:

**Patterns:**

- Request dependencies by trait/interface, not concrete types
- Handle missing dependencies gracefully with fallback strategies
- Minimize dependency coupling through interface abstraction
- Support optional dependencies for enhanced functionality

---

## Performance Optimization

### Component Loading Strategies

**Static Loading (Phase 1):**

- Load all required components during application initialization
- Optimize for predictable startup performance
- Suitable for applications with known component requirements

**Dynamic Loading (Phase 2 - RuntimeSwap):**

- Load components on-demand based on runtime requirements
- Optimize for memory usage and startup time
- Handle loading failures and fallback scenarios

### Communication Optimization

**Intra-Application Communication:**

- Prefer direct singleton registry access for same-process components
- Minimize serialization overhead for local communication
- Use efficient data structures for high-frequency interactions

**Cross-Application Communication:**

- Choose appropriate protocols based on performance requirements
- Implement connection pooling for network-based communication
- Consider message batching for high-throughput scenarios

### Memory Management

These are generic recommendations for software development, not tied to the JigsawFlow pattern

**Component Lifecycle:**

- Implement proper cleanup in component shutdown procedures
- Release expensive resources when components are replaced
- Monitor memory usage in long-running applications

**Resource Sharing:**

- Use singleton registry for sharing expensive resources across components
- Consider resource pooling for frequently created/destroyed objects

---

## Error Handling & Resilience

### Graceful Degradation

Design components to handle dependency failures gracefully:

**Strategies:**

- Implement fallback functionality when dependencies are unavailable
- Provide reduced functionality rather than complete failure
- Log dependency issues for monitoring and debugging

### Module Isolation

Prevent component failures from cascading across the application:

**Techniques:**

- Implement error boundaries around component operations
- Isolate component state to prevent cross-contamination

- Use circuit breaker patterns (if appropriate) to detect and prevent cascading failures when external dependencies become unavailable; this allows the system to recover more quickly from outages and reduces the load on the failed dependency during the outage

### Hot-Swap Safety

Ensure safe component replacement during runtime:

**Guidelines:**

- Implement proper cleanup procedures before component replacement
- Handle in-flight operations during component swapping
- Validate new component compatibility before activation
- Provide rollback mechanisms for failed component updates

---

## Testing Strategies

### Component Testing

**Isolation Testing:**

- Test components in isolation using mocked dependencies
- Verify interface contract compliance
- Test error handling and edge cases

**Integration Testing:**

- Test component interactions through singleton registry
- Verify communication patterns and data flow
- Test component replacement and hot-swapping scenarios

### Builder Pattern Testing

**Factory Function Testing:**

- Test builder functions independently
- Verify constructed object properties and behavior
- Test builder parameter validation and error handling

**Construction Process Testing:**

- Test multi-step construction workflows
- Verify intermediate state handling
- Test construction failure recovery

---

## Security Considerations

### Component Sandboxing

**Trust Boundaries:**

- Establish clear trust levels for different component sources
- Implement sandboxing for untrusted components (future enhancement)
- Validate component signatures and integrity

### Communication Security

**Protocol Security:**

- Use encrypted communication channels for sensitive data
- Implement authentication and authorization for cross-application communication
- Validate message integrity and prevent tampering

### Resource Access Control

**Capability-Based Security:**

- Limit component access to required resources only
- Implement fine-grained permission systems
- Monitor and log resource access patterns

---

## Monitoring & Debugging

### Component Observability

**Logging Strategies:**

- Implement structured logging within components
- Include component identity and version information in logs
- Use correlation IDs for cross-component operation tracking

**Metrics Collection:**

- Monitor component performance and resource usage
- Track component loading and replacement events
- Measure communication latency and throughput

### Debugging Techniques

**Component Inspection:**

- Implement component state inspection capabilities
- Provide debugging interfaces for component introspection
- Support runtime component configuration changes

**Communication Debugging:**

- Log inter-component communication for troubleshooting
- Implement message tracing across component boundaries
- Provide tools for communication pattern visualization

---

## Migration Strategies

### Legacy System Integration

**Incremental Adoption:**

- Start with non-critical system components
- Implement JigsawFlow components alongside existing systems
- Gradually replace legacy components with component-based alternatives

**Wrapper Components:**

- Create JigsawFlow components that wrap existing functionality
- Provide interface adaptation for legacy systems
- Enable gradual migration without system disruption

### Monolith Decomposition

**Boundary Identification:**

- Analyze existing system to identify natural component boundaries
- Prioritize components with clear interfaces and minimal dependencies
- Plan decomposition phases to minimize system disruption

**Data Migration:**

- Handle shared data access during decomposition
- Implement data consistency strategies across components
- Plan for eventual data ownership transfer to appropriate components
