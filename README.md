## Overview

JigsawFlow is a revolutionary microkernel architecture that transforms how enterprise applications are built through a **singleton registry pattern**. Inspired by battle-tested industrial automation systems like PLCs and SCADA architectures, JigsawFlow enables developers to construct robust applications where components access capabilities via standardized traits/interfaces rather than direct coupling.

**Core Philosophy**: JigsawFlow applications emerge from a **singleton registry** that provides trait/interface-based access to all application capabilities. Components can optionally communicate through event-driven patterns when an event orchestrator component is present, but the registry remains the fundamental architecture. Applications can range from simple single-component solutions to complex event-driven networks, all built on the same registry foundation.

The architecture centers on a **singleton registry microkernel** that provides trait/interface-based access to capabilities, with optional event-driven communication when components require it, creating applications that scale through capability composition rather than structural complexity.

---

## What Makes JigsawFlow Different?

### **Singleton Registry Architecture**

JigsawFlow operates through a **singleton registry** that provides trait/interface-based access to capabilities:

**Traditional Approach**: Components have direct dependencies and tight coupling between services.

**JigsawFlow Registry Approach**: Components access capabilities through trait/interface contracts via the singleton registry. When components need event-driven communication, they access an event orchestrator component through the same registry pattern. If no event orchestrator is registered, components gracefully degrade with logging warnings rather than failing.

### **Singleton Registry Microkernel**

JigsawFlow implements a **minimal microkernel** centered on the singleton registry:

**Universal Singleton Registry:**

- Stores ANY singleton struct (components, configs, utilities, models, services)
- Trait/interface-based access with type safety
- Hot-swappable implementations without restart
- Thread-safe singleton replacement
- Graceful degradation when requested capabilities are missing

**Optional Communication Components:**

- Event orchestrator is itself a component registered in the singleton registry
- Communication components (IPC, Bluetooth, UDP, TCP/IP, HTTP) are registered as capabilities
- Components access communication capabilities through the same trait/interface pattern
- When communication components are missing, components log warnings and continue operation
- Communication enhances but doesn't replace the core registry pattern

**Language-Specific Implementations:**

- **Rust**: Trait-based registry access
- **Java/C#**: Interface-based registry access
- **TypeScript**: Type-based registry access
- **Go**: Interface-based registry access

This microkernel enables **capability-based scaling** where applications grow through registry-provided capabilities rather than structural complexity.

### **Unix Microkernel Principles at Application Level**

JigsawFlow applies proven Unix design principles to application architecture:

| **Unix Principle**                 | **JigsawFlow Application**                       |
| ---------------------------------- | ------------------------------------------------ |
| "Everything is a file"             | "Everything is a capability"                     |
| Small tools that do one thing well | Small components with focused responsibilities   |
| Compose via pipes                  | Compose via singleton registry                   |
| Process independence               | Component independence with graceful degradation |
| Hot-swappable kernel modules       | Hot-swappable application components             |

### **Emergent Capability Composition**

The real innovation is **emergent capability access**:

- **Traditional Architecture**: Predefined component hierarchies and explicit dependencies
- **JigsawFlow Architecture**: Applications emerge from available capabilities accessed through trait/interface contracts

Components access capabilities through the registry:

- **Reactive Components**: Access event orchestrator capability when available, gracefully degrade when missing
- **Proactive Components**: Drive application behavior through registry-provided capabilities
- **Foundation Components**: Provide base infrastructure (configs, utilities, core services) via registry

This creates a **capability-centric microkernel** where complex applications arise from simple registry access patterns—similar to how Unix achieved emergent complexity from file and process abstractions.

## Why JigsawFlow?

### **Industrial-Strength Foundation**

JigsawFlow draws inspiration from proven industrial automation patterns:

- **PLC Systems**: Modular, signal-driven components with standardized interfaces
- **SCADA Architecture**: Centralized control with distributed, autonomous components
- **Component-Based Software Engineering (CBSE)**: Reusable, qualified components with defined interfaces
- **Microservice Orchestration**: Loosely coupled services with clear boundaries

### **Enterprise Benefits**

- **Rapid Application Assembly**: Build complex systems by composing pre-built components
- **Zero-Restart Hot-Swapping**: Replace functionality without application downtime (Phase 1 supports DI singleton replacement; Phase 2 adds dynamic library loading via RuntimeSwap)
- **Polyglot System Architecture**: Build cross-language applications through communication components (Bluetooth, P2P, TCP/IP, UDP, Modbus) that enable JigsawFlow implementations across Java, C#, JavaScript/TypeScript, Rust, and other languages to interoperate seamlessly
- **Minimal Integration Overhead**: Singleton registry handles component coordination
- **Community-Driven Ecosystem**: Shared component repository for common functionality

---

## Core Architecture

### **Microkernel Components**

**1. Universal Singleton Registry**

A trait/interface-based singleton store that manages ALL application singletons:

- **Components**: Functional blocks providing capabilities
- **Foundation Infrastructure**: Configs, utilities, models, core services
- **Service Interfaces**: Trait/interface implementations
- **Application State**: Any singleton struct relevant to the application

Features:

- Hot-swappable singleton replacement without restart
- Language-agnostic trait/interface-based access
- Thread-safe concurrent access patterns

**2. Optional Communication Components**

When communication components are registered, they enable various interaction patterns:

- **Event-Driven Communication**: Event orchestrator component provides publish/subscribe capabilities
- **Network Communication**: HTTP, TCP/IP, UDP components provide network-based interaction
- **Inter-Process Communication**: IPC components enable process-to-process communication
- **Device Communication**: Bluetooth, serial, or other protocol components for device interaction
- **Graceful Degradation**: When communication components are missing, applications log warnings and continue
- **Unified Access Pattern**: All communication types accessed through trait/interface contracts via registry

### **Component vs Plugin Distinction**

JigsawFlow uses precise terminology to distinguish between architectural and deployment concepts:

**JigsawFlow Component:**

- Core architectural element that registers with the singleton registry
- Provides specific capabilities through well-defined interfaces
- Behaves like a PLC component with focused responsibilities
- Can be hot-swapped at runtime without application restart
- Examples: Storage Component, Authentication Component, Logging Component

**Plugin:**

- Deployment package that extends application functionality
- May contain one or more components along with additional resources
- Physical distribution mechanism (files, libraries, packages)
- Brings complete solutions including configs, assets, documentation
- Examples: User Management Plugin (containing Auth Component + Profile Component + UI assets)

**Relationship:** Plugins are containers that deliver components to applications. A plugin typically packages related components together with their supporting resources for easy installation and distribution.

### **Three Component Types**

**1. Foundation Components**
Base application infrastructure registered as singletons: configurations, database pools, loggers, utilities, and core services that other components access via trait/interface contracts.

**2. Reactive Components**
Components that access communication capabilities (event orchestrator, HTTP, TCP/IP, UDP, IPC, Bluetooth) through the registry. When communication components are missing, they log warnings and operate in degraded mode rather than failing.

**3. Proactive Components**
Components that drive application behavior through registry-provided capabilities. They may access communication capabilities (events, HTTP, TCP/IP, UDP, IPC, Bluetooth) when available, or operate through direct registry access patterns.

### **Registry-Based Application Assembly**

Applications emerge through **capability registration**:

1. **Initialize Microkernel**: Start singleton registry
2. **Load Foundation Components**: Register base infrastructure (configs, utilities, core services)
3. **Register Capability Components**: Register domain logic components providing trait/interface implementations
4. **Start Application Components**: Components access required capabilities through registry
5. **Optional Communication Enhancement**: Register communication components (event orchestrator, HTTP, TCP/IP, UDP, IPC, Bluetooth) when inter-component or external communication is needed

Components discover and access capabilities through trait/interface-based registry calls, creating scalable applications that gracefully degrade when optional capabilities are missing.

### **The Requirements**

JigsawFlow components must adhere to three fundamental architectural constraints:

- **Offline-First Design**: Components must function when network connectivity is lost (WiFi down, cables cut) but may utilize network protocols when available
- **Component Independence**: Components must not directly depend on other components. Components access capabilities through trait/interface contracts via the registry; when required capabilities are unavailable, components must log warnings and degrade gracefully rather than failing
- **Facade Pattern**: All external dependencies (file I/O, environment access, system calls) must be wrapped through singleton registry facades

_See [best-practices.md](best-practices.md) for detailed implementation guidance and testing strategies._

## Positioning vs. known patterns

| Pattern                          | What it is                          | Where JigsawFlow differs                                                                    |
| -------------------------------- | ----------------------------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| Microkernel / Plug‑in            | Minimal core with plug‑ins          | You formalize plug‑in capabilities and offline‑first guarantees                             |
| Hexagonal (Ports & Adapters)     | Domain wrapped by ports             | Ports/adapters map to service interfaces; singleton registry discovers/binds                |
| Service‑oriented / Microservices | Network‑separated services          | JigsawFlow can be in‑proc or cross‑proc; components are composable without service overhead |
| Actor model                      | Isolated entities exchange messages | Your components can adopt actors internally; the bus covers inter‑component traffic         |
| OSGi/Module systems              | Runtime module lifecycles           | You keep it language‑agnostic and simpler (no classloader tricks)                           |

---

## Future Enhancements

### **Language-Agnostic Interface Standards**

Establish a comprehensive collection of standardized traits/interfaces for common functionality across all supported languages. This standardization addresses two critical areas:

**1. Trait/Interface Standards**

- Define standardized capability contracts (Storage, Authentication, Logging, etc.)
- Enable community-driven component development through well-defined problem-solution interfaces
- Create language-agnostic specifications that translate to idiomatic implementations
- Establish component certification and compatibility frameworks

**2. Event Communication Standards**

- Standardize event-driven communication patterns through trait/interface-based events
- Define event contracts and message shapes for inter-component communication
- Enable components to emit/subscribe to events implementing specific traits/interfaces
- Support both intra-application and cross-application communication networks
- Create rich, standardized communication vocabulary for component networks

This approach mirrors industrial automation standards, where standardized communication protocols enable polyglot systems through well-defined, battle-tested interface specifications—but extends beyond simple signals to rich, trait-based event networks.

### **GUI-as-a-Service Architecture**

**Distributed GUI Rendering Capabilities**

JigsawFlow enables revolutionary GUI architecture where applications become pure business logic while GUI rendering becomes a dedicated capability component:

- **Contract-Based GUI Rendering**: Applications send declarative UI specifications via communication components when available, eliminating the need for GUI libraries in business logic
- **Language-Agnostic GUI Services**: Backend services in Rust, Python, Go, etc. leverage unified GUI infrastructure without language-specific bindings
- **Hot-Swappable UI Components**: GUI components update independently from application logic, enabling live UI theming and layout changes
- **Network-Distributed Applications**: P2P secure connections enable GUI components to run on different machines—applications become truly distributed without installation requirements
- **WorkFlows OS Integration**: GUI service components serve as core system services, providing unified desktop experiences across all applications

**Revolutionary Distribution Model**

The most exciting aspect: applications no longer require local installation. Through secure P2P networking:

- Business logic runs on remote nodes
- GUI renders locally via service contracts
- Applications distribute dynamically across network topology
- Zero-installation application ecosystem emerges naturally

This transforms software distribution from "install and run" to "connect and compose"—applications become network-native capabilities that assemble on-demand.

### **Dynamic Loading Capabilities**

**RuntimeSwap Component Development**

- Hot-loading of dynamic libraries without application restart
- Advanced component versioning and compatibility management
- Runtime component replacement with dependency resolution
- Enhanced security models and sandboxing options for untrusted components
- Performance optimization for dynamic loading scenarios

### **Ecosystem Expansion**

**Community Infrastructure**

- Central component registry with discovery and distribution capabilities
- Community contribution frameworks with quality assurance processes
- Cross-language component bridging and interoperability testing
- Advanced orchestration and monitoring tools for complex component-based systems
- Developer tooling for component creation, testing, and debugging

**Component Governance & Security**

- **Official Component Certification**: Community-vetted components marked as "JigsawFlow Official" (similar to Docker Official Images)
- **Community Voting System**: Democratic selection of idiomatic solutions for common problems
- **Security Inspection Process**: Peer review and automated security scanning for component validation
- **Standard Solution Registry**: Community-defined canonical approaches (similar to WooCommerce in WordPress ecosystem)
- **Trust Levels**: Graduated trust system from community contributions to enterprise-certified components
