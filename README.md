## Overview

JigsawFlow is a revolutionary architecture pattern that transforms how enterprise applications are built and composed. Inspired by battle-tested industrial automation systems like PLCs and SCADA architectures, JigsawFlow enables developers to construct robust applications through **compound modular composition** with minimal integration overhead.

**Core Philosophy**: Following the proven PLC paradigm, JigsawFlow applications emerge through the strategic composition of specialized modules, each focused on solving a specific domain problem. Just as PLC units contribute distinct capabilities to form comprehensive industrial control systems, JigsawFlow modules bring focused expertise—user management, data persistence, communication protocols—that collectively shape the overall application architecture.

Unlike traditional software architecture approaches that require extensive glue code and tight coupling, JigsawFlow applications emerge organically from reusable, interface-compliant modules managed through a centralized dependency injection registry.

## What Makes JigsawFlow Different?

### **Beyond Traditional Dependency Injection**

While JigsawFlow uses dependency injection at its core, it's fundamentally different from standard DI frameworks:

**Traditional DI** (Type-Based):

```rust
// Framework-heavy, type-focused
container.register::<DatabaseService, PostgresImpl>();
let db = container.resolve::<DatabaseService>();
```

**JigsawFlow DI** (Capability-Based):

```rust
// Capability-focused, emergent composition
registry.provide_capability::<Storage>(postgres_module);
let storage = registry.request_capability::<Storage>();
```

### **Unix Microkernel Principles at Application Level**

JigsawFlow applies proven Unix design principles to application architecture:

| **Unix Principle**                 | **JigsawFlow Application**                    |
| ---------------------------------- | --------------------------------------------- |
| "Everything is a file"             | "Everything is a capability"                  |
| Small tools that do one thing well | Small modules with focused responsibilities   |
| Compose via pipes                  | Compose via capability registry               |
| Process independence               | Module independence with graceful degradation |
| Hot-swappable kernel modules       | Hot-swappable application modules             |

### **Emergent System Composition**

The real innovation isn't just modularization—it's **emergent composition**:

- **Traditional Architecture**: Explicitly designed, modules know about each other
- **JigsawFlow Architecture**: Applications emerge from available capabilities, modules declare needs rather than dependencies

This creates a **userspace microkernel** where complex applications arise from simple, composable primitives—just like Unix achieved emergent complexity from basic process and file abstractions.

## Why JigsawFlow?

### **Industrial-Strength Foundation**

JigsawFlow draws inspiration from proven industrial automation patterns:

- **PLC Systems**: Modular, signal-driven components with standardized interfaces
- **SCADA Architecture**: Centralized control with distributed, autonomous components
- **Component-Based Software Engineering (CBSE)**: Reusable, qualified components with defined interfaces
- **Microservice Orchestration**: Loosely coupled services with clear boundaries

### **Enterprise Benefits**

- **Rapid Application Assembly**: Build complex systems by composing pre-built modules
- **Zero-Restart Hot-Swapping**: Replace functionality without application downtime (Phase 1 supports DI singleton replacement; Phase 2 adds dynamic library loading via RuntimeSwap)
- **Polyglot System Architecture**: Build cross-language applications through communication modules (Bluetooth, P2P, TCP/IP, UDP, Modbus) that enable JigsawFlow implementations across Java, C#, JavaScript/TypeScript, Rust, and other languages to interoperate seamlessly
- **Minimal Integration Overhead**: Dependency injection handles module coordination
- **Community-Driven Ecosystem**: Shared module repository for common functionality

---

## Core Architecture

### **Dependency Injection Registry**

The heart of JigsawFlow is a trait/interface-based dependency injection registry - an object that returns singletons by trait/interface - that:

- Registers modules by their capability interfaces, not concrete types
- Enables singleton replacement without application restart
- Provides language-agnostic service discovery

### **Module Interface Compliance**

Every JigsawFlow module implements standardized interfaces for:

- **Interface Definition**: What services the module provides/consumes
- **Module Lifecycle**: Module registration, initialization and cleanup

### **Compound Application Assembly**

Applications are built through **additive composition**:

1. Start with minimal core (DI registry + main thread module)
2. Add functionality by installing interface-compliant modules
3. Modules self-register their capabilities upon loading (modules can focus on or contain multiple solutions)

### **The Requirements**

JigsawFlow modules must adhere to three fundamental architectural constraints:

- **Offline-First Design**: Modules must function when network connectivity is lost (WiFi down, cables cut) but may utilize network protocols when available
- **Module Independence**: Modules must not directly depend on other modules. For shared functionality, prefer extracting it into a separate shared module; when dependencies are unavailable, modules should log and degrade gracefully
- **Facade Pattern**: All external dependencies (file I/O, environment access, system calls) must be wrapped through DI-registered facades

_See [best-practices.md](best-practices.md) for detailed implementation guidance and testing strategies._

## Positioning vs. known patterns

| Pattern                          | What it is                          | Where JigsawFlow differs                                                                 |
| -------------------------------- | ----------------------------------- | ---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| Microkernel / Plug‑in            | Minimal core with plug‑ins          | You formalize plug‑in capabilities and offline‑first guarantees                          |
| Hexagonal (Ports & Adapters)     | Domain wrapped by ports             | Ports/adapters map to capability interfaces; registry discovers/binds                    |
| Service‑oriented / Microservices | Network‑separated services          | JigsawFlow can be in‑proc or cross‑proc; modules are composable without service overhead |
| Actor model                      | Isolated entities exchange messages | Your modules can adopt actors internally; the bus covers inter‑module traffic            |
| OSGi/Module systems              | Runtime module lifecycles           | You keep it language‑agnostic and simpler (no classloader tricks)                        |

## Future Enhancements

### **Language-Agnostic Interface Standards**

Establish a comprehensive collection of standardized traits/interfaces for common functionality across all supported languages. This standardization addresses two critical areas:

**1. DI Registry Capability Standards**

- Define problem-solution contracts through standardized trait/interface definitions
- Enable community-driven module development where modules provide solutions to well-defined problems
- Create language-agnostic specifications that translate to idiomatic implementations in each target language
- Establish module certification and compatibility frameworks

**2. Communication Protocol Definitions**

- Standardize event-driven communication patterns across protocol boundaries
- Define message shapes and interface contracts for inter-module communication
- Enable modules to send events implementing specific traits/interfaces while other modules listen for compatible event types
- Support both intra-application and cross-application communication patterns

This approach mirrors industrial automation standards, where discussed contracts enable polyglot systems through well-defined, battle-tested interface specifications.

### **Dynamic Loading Capabilities**

**RuntimeSwap Module Development**

- Hot-loading of dynamic libraries without application restart
- Advanced module versioning and compatibility management
- Runtime module replacement with dependency resolution
- Enhanced security models and sandboxing options for untrusted modules
- Performance optimization for dynamic loading scenarios

### **Ecosystem Expansion**

**Community Infrastructure**

- Central module registry with discovery and distribution capabilities
- Community contribution frameworks with quality assurance processes
- Cross-language module bridging and interoperability testing
- Advanced orchestration and monitoring tools for complex modular systems
- Developer tooling for module creation, testing, and debugging

**Module Governance & Security**

- **Official Module Certification**: Community-vetted modules marked as "JigsawFlow Official" (similar to Docker Official Images)
- **Community Voting System**: Democratic selection of idiomatic solutions for common problems
- **Security Inspection Process**: Peer review and automated security scanning for module validation
- **Standard Solution Registry**: Community-defined canonical approaches (similar to WooCommerce in WordPress ecosystem)
- **Trust Levels**: Graduated trust system from community contributions to enterprise-certified modules
