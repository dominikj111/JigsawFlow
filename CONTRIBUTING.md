## Development Guidelines

### **JigsawFlow Architectural Requirements**

All contributions must adhere to the three fundamental constraints:

1. **Offline-First Design**: Components must function when network connectivity is lost but may utilize network protocols when available
2. **Component Independence**: Components must not directly depend on other components; extract shared functionality into separate components
3. **Facade Pattern**: All external dependencies must be wrapped through DI-registered facades

### **Code Quality Standards**

**Interface-First Design**

- Define clear trait/interface contracts before implementation
- Follow dependency inversion principles
- Ensure single responsibility per component
- Design for testability and mocking

**Industrial-Grade Reliability**

- Implement graceful degradation when dependencies are unavailable
- Add comprehensive error handling and logging
- Follow battle-tested patterns from PLC/SCADA systems
- Ensure hot-swappable component replacement

**Cross-Language Compatibility**

- Use language-agnostic interface definitions
- Support polyglot system architecture
- Enable communication across language boundaries
- Maintain consistent patterns across implementations

### **Testing Requirements**

- **Unit Tests**: Test individual component functionality in isolation
- **Integration Tests**: Verify component composition and DI registry behavior
- **Offline Tests**: Validate offline-first behavior and graceful degradation
- **Hot-Swap Tests**: Ensure components can be replaced without application restart

### **Documentation Standards**

- Include comprehensive API documentation with examples
- Document architectural decisions and trade-offs
- Provide troubleshooting guides for common issues
- Write clear, concise commit messages following conventional commit format
